beyonnex.io BE Developer Task

Write an interactive Java program that provides these 2 features: 

**1 - Checks if two texts are anagrams of each other. 
2 - Out of all inputs to Feature #1: provides all the anagrams for a given string.** 

Inputs to Feature #1 do not need to persisted across multiple runs of your program.
The mode of interactivity is not important. Choose what's easiest and quickest for you, 
a simple CLI interface is enough.

For Feature #1: Please follow the definition described in the english wikipedia page for anagram. [Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)
For Feature #2: - Given these hypothetical invocations of the Feature #1 
function -> f1(A, B), 
f1(A, C), 
f1(A, D) 
- *IF* A, B and D are anagrams 
- f2(A) should return [B, D] 
- f2(B) should return [A, D] 
- f2(C) should return []

Feel free to use your favorite: 
- IDE - 
- Language; the solution has to be either Java 8+ or Kotlin 
- code-hosting; the solution must be publicly accessible 
- You can prioritize however you like (performance, readability, extensibility, ...)

- P.S. Googling is a good thing :-)

***RESULT***: The [beyonnex.io](https://beyonnex.io/en#about-us):put_litter_in_its_place:  just ghosted me for a long time even though I pinged them several times. They blamed [DevOp.One](https://devop.one/):put_litter_in_its_place: , their recruiting partner, who somehow couldn't reach me. Both parties have my email and phone numbers :disappointed:

*At least they had the ethics to mention that my task was accepted as a passed one.*

As a result, interesting task, a waste of 6 hours of personal time, very bad internal and external recruiting team :thumbsdown:
